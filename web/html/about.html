<p>Naturally, the site will be updated while I keep reading comics.</p>

Marvel comics, obviously, not only for providing awesome stories but for their 
<a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Developer API</a>. 
Get your own developer account and start creating apps yourself.

<li>
<a href="http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/">Comic Book Herald</a>, 
I used its reading orders as reference most of time, then I modified them by my personal preference.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/">MARVEL Wiki</a>, 
for all the help that MARVEL API could not provide.
